# ðŸ“Œ Approach & Optimization  

âœ… **Brute Force**: `O(N^2)` â€“ Check every pair (inefficient).  
âœ… **Optimized Approach**: `O(N)` â€“ Track min price & max profit in one pass.  

### Key Learnings  
- **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm** idea helps here.  
- **Single pass approach** is efficient for array-based problems.
